  <Description>Dynamics 365/CE Application Insights logging for JavaScript. This contains the minified, unminified, map, TypeScript, and TypeScript definition files needed to implement Application Insights logging as well as the content from the original Microsoft implementation. 
    This is only marked as prerelease because it takes dependencies on 2 Microsoft libraries that are versioned in such a way that they show up in NuGet as prerelease. NuGet currently forbids packaging prerelease dependencies with non-prerelease packages. </Description>
